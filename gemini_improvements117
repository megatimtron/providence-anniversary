## **Detailed Playlist Builder Prompt for Copilot: Stepping Out the Implementation**

This prompt breaks down the "Comprehensive Playlist Builder" into more granular steps, focusing on specific UI/UX, backend logic, and API interactions.

-----

### **Project Goal:**

Develop a web application that serves as a collaborative playlist builder, seamlessly integrating music and video content from **Qobuz**, **Spotify**, and **YouTube** into a unified interface for shared listening experiences.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication**

**1.1 User Authentication & Account Linking:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a new user, I want to sign up with email/password or a social login (e.g., Google, GitHub) so I can access the application.
      * As a registered user, I want to securely log in to my account.
      * As a logged-in user, I want to connect my Spotify account via OAuth 2.0.
      * As a logged-in user, I want to connect my Qobuz account via their API (requires developer access and potentially API key/secret handling).
      * As a logged-in user, I want to connect my YouTube account via OAuth 2.0 (Google API Console for YouTube Data API).
      * As a logged-in user, I want to see which accounts are currently linked or unlinked.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Login/Registration Page:** Clean, intuitive forms with clear input fields and buttons.
      * **Account Settings/Profile Page:** A dedicated section where users can initiate OAuth flows for Spotify and YouTube, and input/manage Qobuz API credentials. Display connection status (e.g., "Spotify Connected," "YouTube Disconnected").
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Implement user registration and login endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`).
      * Securely store user credentials (hashed passwords).
      * Handle OAuth callbacks for Spotify and YouTube, exchanging authorization codes for access and refresh tokens.
      * Securely store access and refresh tokens for each platform, associated with the user's profile in the database.
      * Develop endpoints to refresh expired tokens automatically.
  * **API Interaction (Initial):**
      * **Spotify:** `GET https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize`, `POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`
      * **YouTube:** `GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`, `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`
      * **Qobuz:** Specific authentication flow as per their developer documentation (may involve API key headers for subsequent requests).

### **Phase 2: Search & Playlist Creation**

**2.1 Centralized Search & Results Display:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want a single search bar to find music and videos across all linked platforms.
      * As a user, I want to see search results categorized by platform (e.g., "Spotify Tracks," "YouTube Videos," "Qobuz Albums").
      * As a user, I want to see relevant metadata for each search result (e.g., title, artist, album art/thumbnail, duration, source platform icon).
      * As a user, I want to quickly add a search result to my current playlist.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Main Dashboard/Search Page:** Prominent search bar.
      * **Search Results Area:** Divided sections or clear labels for each platform. Each result should be a distinct card or row with an "Add to Playlist" button.
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * An API endpoint (e.g., `/api/search?q=`) that, when called, simultaneously queries the Spotify, Qobuz, and YouTube APIs.
      * Aggregate and normalize search results into a consistent data structure (e.g., `id`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `thumbnailUrl`, `duration`, `sourcePlatform`, `externalUrl`).
      * Handle rate limits for each API.
  * **API Interaction:**
      * **Spotify:** `GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q={query}&type=track`
      * **Qobuz:** `GET {Qobuz_API_BASE}/track/search?q={query}`
      * **YouTube:** `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&q={query}&type=video`

**2.2 Playlist Creation & Basic Management:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want to create a new, empty playlist and give it a name.
      * As a user, I want to see all tracks/videos currently in my active playlist.
      * As a user, I want to remove a track/video from my playlist.
      * As a user, I want to reorder tracks within my playlist using drag-and-drop.
      * As a user, I want to save my playlist to my account for future access.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Playlist Sidebar/Area:** A clear section displaying the current playlist, with drag handles for reordering, and a "remove" icon for each item.
      * "Create New Playlist" button.
      * "Save Playlist" button.
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Database schema to store playlists (e.g., `playlistId`, `userId`, `name`, `items: []`).
      * Each `item` in the playlist should store the normalized metadata (id, title, artist, sourcePlatform, externalUrl, etc.) and crucially, the specific identifier (e.g., Spotify track ID, YouTube video ID, Qobuz track ID) to later retrieve/play the content.
      * Endpoints for: `POST /api/playlists` (create), `PUT /api/playlists/{id}` (update/save), `GET /api/playlists/{id}` (retrieve), `DELETE /api/playlists/{id}/item/{itemId}` (remove item).

### **Phase 3: Playback & Collaboration**

**3.1 Cross-Platform Playback (Unified Player):**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want to play tracks/videos directly from the playlist interface.
      * As a user, I want the player to automatically switch based on the source platform of the currently playing item.
      * As a user, I want basic playback controls (play, pause, next, previous) for the currently active player.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * A persistent player component at the bottom or top of the screen.
      * The player area dynamically renders the appropriate embedded player (YouTube iframe, Spotify Web Playback SDK, or a custom audio player for Qobuz).
  * **Frontend Logic:**
      * When a track is selected, check its `sourcePlatform`.
      * Dynamically load and interact with the respective SDK/API:
          * **YouTube:** Embed `<iframe>` with `enablejsapi=1` to control playback.
          * **Spotify:** Integrate the Spotify Web Playback SDK for playback control (requires user to have premium and an active Spotify tab/device). Alternatively, use the `external_urls.spotify` link to open in Spotify app.
          * **Qobuz:** Use their streaming API (if available for web player) or provide a direct link to open in the Qobuz app/web player. A simple HTML5 `<audio>` element can be used if a direct stream URL can be obtained via their API.
      * Implement state management to track the currently playing item and its source.
  * **API Interaction:**
      * **YouTube:** `YT.Player` API for `playVideo()`, `pauseVideo()`, `nextVideo()`, etc.
      * **Spotify:** `WebPlaybackSDK` methods like `player.play()`, `player.pause()`, `player.nextTrack()`.
      * **Qobuz:** Investigate their streaming endpoints for direct playback or deep linking.

**3.2 Collaborative Playlists (Real-time Updates):**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a playlist creator, I want to share my playlist with others via a unique URL.
      * As a collaborator, I want to join a shared playlist via its URL.
      * As a collaborator, I want to see real-time updates when others add, remove, or reorder tracks in the playlist.
      * (Optional) As a playlist owner, I want to control who can edit the playlist (e.g., invite specific users, set to read-only).
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * "Share" button on playlist page, generating a shareable URL.
      * Clear visual indicators for real-time updates (e.g., new items subtly highlighted).
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Implement WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time communication.
      * When a playlist is updated (item added/removed/reordered), broadcast the changes to all connected clients viewing that playlist.
      * Generate unique, non-guessable shareable IDs for playlists.
      * (Optional) Add a `sharedPermissions` field to the playlist database schema (e.g., "public\_read", "public\_edit", "private").

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Future Enhancements**

**4.1 Deployment Considerations:**

  * **Frontend Hosting:** Static site hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) for the React/Vue/Angular build.
  * **Backend Hosting:** Cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2/Lambda, Google Cloud Run/App Engine, Heroku) for the Node.js/Python server.
  * **Database Hosting:** Managed database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
  * **HTTPS:** Ensure all traffic is secured with SSL/TLS.

**4.2 Future Enhancements (Stretch Goals):**

  * **Import Existing Playlists:** Allow users to import their existing playlists from Spotify or Qobuz.
  * **Export Playlist:** Option to export the unified playlist to a text file or a specific platform's format (if supported).
  * **User Preferences:** Settings for default playback platform, dark mode, etc.
  * **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Based on the current playlist, suggest similar tracks/videos from across all platforms.
  * **Community Playlists:** Publicly browseable playlists created by other users.
  * **Offline Support:** Caching playlist data for offline viewing (though playback would still require internet).
  * **Mobile App:** Convert the web app into a progressive web app (PWA) or develop native mobile applications.

This detailed prompt provides a solid roadmap for a copilot to begin implementation, covering all major components and interactions.
\<br\>
It appears I made a slight error in the previous response when adding the `GET https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize` and `POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` placeholders for Spotify authentication. These are not real URLs but rather artifacts from a previous search result that got accidentally inserted. I should correct this to reflect the actual Spotify API endpoints as provided by the search results (which correctly indicate `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize` for the authorization URL and `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` for the token exchange).

Also, for Qobuz, the search results indicate that their API requires direct contact for credentials and uses OAuth 2.0. This means it's not as straightforward as just plugging in a client ID/secret. For playback, direct web player streaming might be complex due to DRM and specific agreements, and some community tools resort to UPnP/DLNA or dedicated local streamers. The prompt should acknowledge this complexity.

I will revise the detailed prompt to incorporate these corrections and provide more accurate and practical advice regarding the Qobuz API and Spotify URLs, making it even more actionable for a copilot.

Here's the revised and even more detailed prompt for the "Comprehensive Playlist Builder," taking into account the nuances of the API integrations:

## **Detailed Playlist Builder Prompt for Copilot: Stepping Out the Implementation (Revised)**

This prompt breaks down the "Comprehensive Playlist Builder" into more granular steps, focusing on specific UI/UX, backend logic, and API interactions, with corrections for API endpoint accuracy and Qobuz specific considerations.

-----

### **Project Goal:**

Develop a web application that serves as a collaborative playlist builder, seamlessly integrating music and video content from **Qobuz**, **Spotify**, and **YouTube** into a unified interface for shared listening experiences.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication**

**1.1 User Authentication & Account Linking:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a new user, I want to sign up with email/password so I can create and manage playlists.
      * As a registered user, I want to securely log in to my account.
      * As a logged-in user, I want to connect my Spotify account via OAuth 2.0 to access my Spotify data and play tracks.
      * As a logged-in user, I want to connect my YouTube account via OAuth 2.0 to access YouTube videos and manage content.
      * As a logged-in user, I want to link my Qobuz account using provided API credentials (API ID, Secret) to search and retrieve Qobuz content. *(Note: Qobuz API access often requires direct contact and approval.)*
      * As a logged-in user, I want to see which music/video service accounts are currently linked or unlinked in my profile settings.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Login/Registration Page:** Clean, intuitive forms with fields for email, password, and "Sign Up" / "Log In" buttons.
      * **Account Settings/Profile Page:** A dedicated section (e.g., "Connected Services") listing Spotify, YouTube, and Qobuz. Each service should have a clear "Connect" button that initiates the OAuth flow or prompts for API credentials. Display a status indicator (e.g., "Connected," "Not Connected," "Error").
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Implement user registration and login endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`) using a robust authentication library (e.g., Passport.js in Node.js, Flask-Login in Python). Securely store hashed passwords.
      * Handle OAuth callbacks for Spotify and YouTube:
          * Upon successful authorization, exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens.
          * Securely store these tokens in the database, linked to the user's account. Encrypt sensitive tokens at rest.
      * Develop endpoints to automatically refresh expired access tokens using stored refresh tokens.
      * For Qobuz, create an endpoint to receive and securely store the user's Qobuz API ID and Secret, assuming the user obtains these directly from Qobuz. Validate these credentials if possible upon submission.
  * **API Interaction (Initial Authentication Flows):**
      * **Spotify (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for SPAs):**
          * **Authorization URL:** `GET https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize` (with `client_id`, `response_type=code`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state`, `code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method=S256`).
          * **Token Exchange URL:** `POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` (with `grant_type=authorization_code`, `code`, `redirect_uri`, `client_id`, `code_verifier`).
      * **YouTube Data API (OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications):**
          * **Authorization URL:** `GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth` (with `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `response_type=code`, `scope`, `access_type=offline`).
          * **Token Exchange URL:** `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` (with `code`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`, `grant_type=authorization_code`).
      * **Qobuz API:** Consult official Qobuz API documentation for specific authentication methods. It often involves using an Application ID and Application Secret obtained after contacting Qobuz directly (`api@qobuz.com`). Subsequent API requests typically require these credentials in headers or query parameters.

### **Phase 2: Search & Playlist Creation**

**2.1 Centralized Search & Results Display:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want a single, prominent search bar to find music and videos.
      * As a user, I want search results to be displayed clearly, grouped or labeled by their source platform (Spotify, Qobuz, YouTube).
      * As a user, I want to see essential metadata for each result: title, artist(s), album/source, duration, album art/video thumbnail, and a clear icon indicating the source platform.
      * As a user, I want a visible "Add to Playlist" button next to each search result.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Main Dashboard/Search Page:** A large, easily accessible search input field.
      * **Search Results Area:** A dynamic grid or list of results. Implement lazy loading for long result lists. Use distinct visual cues (e.g., color-coded borders, platform logos) to differentiate sources.
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Create a dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `/api/search?q=`) that acts as a proxy.
      * When this endpoint is hit, it should make concurrent requests to the respective search APIs of Spotify, Qobuz, and YouTube, using the user's stored access tokens/credentials.
      * Aggregate and *normalize* the responses from all three APIs into a consistent JSON structure (e.g., `id`, `title`, `artist`, `album/source`, `thumbnailUrl`, `duration_ms`, `sourcePlatform`, `externalUrl`, `platformSpecificId`).
      * Implement efficient caching for popular search queries to reduce API calls and improve responsiveness.
      * Handle potential rate limits from each external API gracefully (e.g., with exponential backoff and retry mechanisms).
  * **API Interaction (Search):**
      * **Spotify:** `GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q={query}&type=track,album,artist` (using user's access token).
      * **Qobuz:** `GET https://www.qobuz.com/api.json/0.2/track/search?query={query}&app_id={id}&app_secret={secret}` (requires Qobuz API ID/Secret).
      * **YouTube:** `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&q={query}&type=video` (using user's access token).

**2.2 Playlist Creation & Basic Management:**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want to create a new, empty playlist and provide a name and optional description.
      * As a user, I want to view all my saved playlists on a dedicated page or sidebar.
      * As a user, I want to select an existing playlist to add items to it or edit its contents.
      * As a user, I want to remove individual tracks/videos from a playlist.
      * As a user, I want to reorder tracks within a playlist using a drag-and-drop interface.
      * As a user, I want my playlist changes to be automatically saved or have a clear save button.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Playlist List Page/Sidebar:** Displays user's playlists as clickable cards/rows.
      * **Active Playlist View:** A dedicated area (e.g., right sidebar or main content area) showing the selected playlist's items. Each item should have a drag handle and a delete icon.
      * **New Playlist Modal/Form:** Simple form for naming a playlist.
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * **Database Schema:** Design a database schema for playlists (e.g., a `playlists` collection/table with fields like `_id`, `userId`, `name`, `description`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `isShared`).
      * **Playlist Items Schema:** Each playlist document/row should contain an array of `items`. Each `item` object must store:
          * `platformSpecificId`: The original ID from Spotify, YouTube, or Qobuz (critical for playback).
          * `sourcePlatform`: (`'spotify'`, `'youtube'`, `'qobuz'`).
          * `title`, `artist`, `thumbnailUrl`, `duration_ms`, `externalUrl`: Normalized metadata.
          * `orderIndex`: An integer to maintain the order of items.
      * **Endpoints:**
          * `POST /api/playlists`: Create new playlist.
          * `GET /api/playlists`: Retrieve all user's playlists.
          * `GET /api/playlists/{id}`: Retrieve a specific playlist and its items.
          * `PUT /api/playlists/{id}/add`: Add an item to a playlist (takes normalized item data).
          * `DELETE /api/playlists/{id}/item/{itemId}`: Remove an item from a playlist.
          * `PUT /api/playlists/{id}/reorder`: Update item order based on a new `orderIndex` array.
          * `PUT /api/playlists/{id}`: Update playlist metadata (name, description).

### **Phase 3: Playback & Collaboration**

**3.1 Cross-Platform Playback (Unified Player):**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a user, I want to play any track or video from my playlist directly within the application.
      * As a user, I want the player controls (play, pause, next, previous, volume) to be consistent, regardless of the source.
      * As a user, I want to see the currently playing track/video's title, artist, and album art/thumbnail.
      * As a user, I want the player to automatically queue the next track in the playlist.
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Persistent Player Bar:** A non-intrusive player bar (e.g., fixed at the bottom of the viewport) showing current track info, playback controls, and a progress bar.
      * The main content area of the player should dynamically render the appropriate embedded player (YouTube iframe, Spotify Web Playback SDK, or a custom audio player).
  * **Frontend Logic:**
      * Maintain a global state for the "currently playing" item (its normalized data, including `platformSpecificId` and `sourcePlatform`).
      * **Dynamic Player Rendering:** Use conditional rendering to display the correct player component based on `sourcePlatform`:
          * **YouTube:** Embed an `<iframe>` using the YouTube Player API. Initialize the player with `enablejsapi=1` and `origin` for cross-domain control. Use methods like `player.loadVideoById()`, `player.playVideo()`, `player.pauseVideo()`, `player.setVolume()`.
          * **Spotify:** Integrate the Spotify Web Playback SDK. This creates a virtual Spotify Connect device in the browser. Users *must* have a Spotify Premium account to use this SDK directly. Utilize SDK methods like `player.connect()`, `player.togglePlay()`, `player.nextTrack()`, `player.previousTrack()`, `player.setVolume()`. Handle `authentication_error` (e.g., "Premium required").
          * **Qobuz:** This is the most challenging for direct playback due to DRM and API limitations for third-party web streaming.
              * **Option A (Best Effort):** If the Qobuz API provides a direct stream URL for authorized users, use a standard HTML5 `<audio>` element. This is often *not* available for full tracks due to licensing.
              * **Option B (Deep Linking):** Provide a "Play in Qobuz App" button that uses a deep link (e.g., `qobuz://track/{qobuz_track_id}`).
              * **Option C (Community/Advanced):** Explore community-driven reverse-engineered APIs (with caution and full understanding of legal/ethical implications) or consider if there's a Qobuz equivalent of Spotify Connect for web integration (currently, less common). **For initial MVP, Option B is safest and most feasible.**
      * Implement event listeners for player state changes (e.g., `onEnded` from YouTube, `player_state_changed` from Spotify) to automatically play the next track in the playlist.

**3.2 Collaborative Playlists (Real-time Updates):**

  * **User Stories:**
      * As a playlist creator, I want to generate a unique, shareable link for my playlist.
      * As a collaborator, I want to access and view a playlist using its shareable link.
      * As a collaborator, I want to see real-time updates (additions, removals, reordering) made by other collaborators.
      * (Optional) As a playlist owner, I want to invite specific users and set their permissions (e.g., view-only, edit access).
  * **UI/UX Details:**
      * **Share Button/Modal:** A prominent "Share" button on each playlist page. Clicking it opens a modal with the shareable URL and options (if implemented) for setting permissions.
      * Real-time UI updates: Newly added items could briefly animate or have a subtle highlight. Removed items disappear smoothly.
  * **Backend Logic:**
      * Implement **WebSockets** (e.g., using Socket.IO, WebSockets in Node.js, or Channels in Django) for real-time bidirectional communication.
      * When a playlist is created, generate a unique, non-guessable `shareId` (e.g., UUID).
      * When a user connects via WebSocket to a shared playlist's `shareId`, authenticate them and subscribe them to updates for that playlist.
      * Whenever an item is added, removed, or reordered in the backend, broadcast a message (e.g., `playlist-updated` event with the new playlist state) to all clients subscribed to that `shareId`.
      * **Authorization for Shared Playlists:**
          * For basic sharing, any user with the `shareId` can view.
          * For editing, check if the authenticated user is the owner or has explicit edit permissions (requires additional database fields for `collaborators` or `permissions`).

### **Phase 4: Technical Stack & Deployment**

**4.1 Recommended Technical Stack:**

  * **Frontend:** React (with a state management library like Zustand or React Query for API interactions and global state), Next.js for SSR/SSG.
  * **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js or Fastify (for REST APIs and WebSocket server).
  * **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL, flexible schema for playlist items) or PostgreSQL (SQL, with JSONB fields for flexibility).
  * **WebSockets:** Socket.IO for ease of implementation.
  * **Authentication:** Passport.js (Node.js) or JWT for token-based authentication.

**4.2 Deployment Considerations:**

  * **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify for effortless deployment of the Next.js/React application.
  * **Backend Hosting:** Render, Railway, or a traditional cloud VM (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine) for the Node.js server. Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
  * **Database Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas (managed service) or a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance.
  * **HTTPS:** Crucial for all communication; ensure proper SSL/TLS certificates are configured for both frontend and backend.

### **Phase 5: Future Enhancements (Stretch Goals)**

  * **Import Existing Playlists:** Allow users to import their existing playlists directly from Spotify or Qobuz into the unified builder. This requires additional API calls (e.g., Spotify's "Get User's Playlists" and "Get Playlist Items" endpoints).
  * **Export Playlist:** Provide functionality to export the created unified playlist back to Spotify or potentially Qobuz (if their API supports playlist creation).
  * **User Preferences:** Implement user settings for default player volume, theme (light/dark mode), and notification preferences.
  * **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Leverage machine learning models (or simple collaborative filtering) to suggest new tracks/videos from across all platforms based on the current playlist's content or user listening history.
  * **"Our Song" Section:** Integrate the specific "Our Song" feature from the initial prompt, allowing couples to designate and highlight special tracks within their shared playlists.
  * **Mobile App (PWA/Native):** Extend the web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a more app-like experience on mobile, or explore native mobile app development.
