Here are some suggested improvements for the "Providence Anniversary Weekend Planner" website, which can be used with a code copilot like Sonnet 4 in VS Code:

### Design and User Experience (UX) Enhancements

* **Responsive Design:** Implement a robust responsive design to ensure the site looks and functions seamlessly across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Enhance the site's navigation system, potentially including a sticky header or a clear menu structure, to improve ease of access to different sections like "Plan," "Restaurants," and "Notes."
* **Visual Appeal:** Integrate high-quality images of Providence landmarks, scenic views, and featured restaurants to create a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing experience.
* **Consistency:** Ensure consistent styling, typography, and spacing throughout the site for a polished and professional look.

### Functionality Improvements

* **Enhanced Restaurant Filtering and Sorting:** For Providence Restaurant Week, add filtering options by cuisine type, price range, and dietary restrictions. Include sorting capabilities by user rating (if applicable) or distance from a central point.
* **Interactive Map Features:** Augment the existing interactive map to potentially include:
    * User-defined points of interest (e.g., specific shops, historical sites).
    * Integration with real-time public transit information or walking directions.
    * Clickable restaurant markers that display quick info snippets (e.g., cuisine, price, link to menu).
* **Dynamic Itinerary Management:** Allow users to easily add, remove, or reorder itinerary items directly on the page, with changes saving automatically (or with a clear save option).
* **"Couple's Notes & Memories" Section Enhancements:**
    * Implement robust photo upload functionality with image preview and simple editing capabilities (e.g., rotate, crop).
    * Add an export feature, allowing the couple to download their notes and photos as a PDF or a structured document.
    * Consider a "share" option (e.g., via email or social media) for selected memories.
* **Calendar Integration:** Allow users to add specific events or restaurant reservations from the itinerary directly to their personal calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).

### Content and Information Augmentation

* **Expanded Activities and Attractions:** Include a broader range of romantic or popular activities in Providence beyond dining, such as museums, parks, shopping areas, and cultural experiences.
* **Comprehensive Transportation Guide:** Provide detailed information on getting around Providence, including public transportation options (RIPTA), ride-sharing services, and parking recommendations for key areas.
* **Real-time Weather Integration:** Display current weather conditions and a multi-day forecast for Providence during the trip dates.
* **Local Tips and Recommendations:** Add a section for local tips, such as best times to visit certain attractions, hidden gems, or safety information.

### Technical and Performance Optimizations

* **Performance Optimization:**
    * Optimize image sizes and formats for faster loading times.
    * Minify CSS and JavaScript files.
    * Implement browser caching strategies for static assets.

    * Proper alt text for all images.
