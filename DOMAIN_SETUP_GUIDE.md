# üåê iloveugo.com Domain Setup Guide

## Option A: Point Domain to Your Raspberry Pi (FREE hosting)

### Step 1: Buy the Domain
1. Go to **Namecheap.com** or your preferred registrar
2. Search for `iloveugo.com`
3. Purchase the domain (usually $10-15/year)

### Step 2: Find Your Home IP Address
```bash
# Run this on your Mac to find your public IP
curl ifconfig.me
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Router
1. Open your router admin panel (usually http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.1)
2. Look for "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server"
3. Add this rule:
   - **Service Name**: Web Server
   - **External Port**: 80
   - **Internal IP**: 192.168.68.69 (your Pi's IP)
   - **Internal Port**: 80
   - **Protocol**: TCP

### Step 4: Set Up DNS Records
In your domain registrar's control panel:

**A Record:**
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Value**: [Your public IP from Step 2]
- **TTL**: 3600

**CNAME Record:**
- **Name**: www
- **Value**: iloveugo.com
- **TTL**: 3600

### Step 5: Update Nginx on Pi
```bash
ssh timothytremaglio@192.168.68.69

# Edit nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/provitinerary
```

Change the server_name line to:
```nginx
server_name iloveugo.com www.iloveugo.com;
```

Then restart nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
