## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE: DNS Configuration

### Problem
`iloveugo.com` is **still pointing to GoDaddy Website Builder** instead of Netlify.

### Evidence
```bash
curl -I https://iloveugo.com
# Returns: Server: DPS/2.0.0+sha-d969522 (GoDaddy)
# Should return: Server: Netlify
```

### DNS Lookup Results
```bash
nslookup iloveugo.com
# Shows multiple A records:
# - 75.2.60.5 (Netlify) ✅
# - 76.223.105.230 (Other)
# - 13.248.243.5 (Other)
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Complete DNS Fix (User Action Required)
**You need to log into your domain registrar and update DNS records as per `DNS_FIX_GUIDE.md`:**

1. **Remove conflicting A records** pointing to GoDaddy IPs
2. **Keep only** the Netlify A record: `75.2.60.5`
3. **Add CNAME** for www pointing to your Netlify subdomain

### Step 2: Verify Netlify Deployment
Once DNS is fixed, verify the site loads correctly:
- `https://iloveugo.com` should show the Providence Anniversary app
- Server headers should show `Netlify` instead of `DPS/2.0.0`

### Step 3: Browser Cache
Clear Safari cache and hard refresh after DNS changes:
- **Safari**: ⌘+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- **Or**: Safari → Develop → Empty Caches

## 📋 DNS Fix Checklist

### ❌ Current DNS (Needs Fix)
- Multiple A records causing conflicts
- GoDaddy Website Builder still active
- DNS pointing to wrong IPs

### ✅ Target DNS (What You Need)
- **A Record**: `iloveugo.com` → `75.2.60.5` (Netlify only)
- **CNAME**: `www.iloveugo.com` → `[your-site].netlify.app`
- **Remove**: All GoDaddy A records

---

## 🔍 How to Check When Fixed

### Test 1: HTTP Headers
```bash
curl -I https://iloveugo.com
# Should show: Server: Netlify
```

### Test 2: Site Content
- Visit `https://iloveugo.com`
- Should see: "Providence Anniversary Itinerary" 
- Should have: Working playlist builder, love notes, interactive itinerary

### Test 3: DNS Resolution
```bash
nslookup iloveugo.com
# Should show only: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify IP)
```

## 🆘 If Still Not Working After DNS Fix

### Possible Issues:
1. **DNS Propagation**: Can take 24-48 hours globally
2. **Netlify Configuration**: May need to re-add custom domain
3. **SSL Certificate**: Netlify may need to regenerate certificate

### Solutions:
1. **Wait**: DNS propagation takes time
2. **Netlify Dashboard**: Check domain settings and SSL status
3. **Browser**: Clear all caches and try incognito mode
