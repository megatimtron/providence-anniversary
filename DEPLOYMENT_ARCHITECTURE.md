# 🚀 Deployment Architecture & Auto-Deploy Options

## Current Setup Overview

### 🏠 Raspberry Pi (Local Network)
- **URL**: http://192.168.68.69
- **Access**: Only from your local network (WiFi/Ethernet)
- **Purpose**: Testing, local development, family access
- **Your Public IP**: 24.151.105.214 (if you want external access)

### 🌐 Netlify (Public Internet)
- **URL**: iloveugo.com (after domain setup)
- **Access**: Anyone on the internet
- **Purpose**: Public sharing, mobile access anywhere
- **Hosting**: Professional CDN with global edge locations

## 🔄 Auto-Deploy Options

### Option 1: Simple Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
**What it does**: Updates both Pi and Netlify package when you commit changes

```bash
# Make changes to your website
nano index.html

# Auto-deploy to both Pi and Netlify
./auto_deploy.sh
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Pi immediately updated at http://192.168.68.69
- ✅ Netlify package ready (manual drag-drop to Netlify)

### Option 2: Full Git Integration (Advanced)
**What it does**: Completely automatic - updates both sites when you `git push`

```bash
# Setup GitHub + Netlify integration
./setup_netlify_git_integration.sh

# Then just push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated anniversary plans"
git push
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Pi automatically updated
- ✅ iloveugo.com automatically updated
- ✅ No manual steps needed!

### Option 3: Real-Time Watching (Developer Mode)
**What it does**: Watches for file changes and auto-deploys

```bash
./watch_and_deploy.sh
# Now edit files - saves automatically deploy!
```

## 🌍 External Access Options

### Option A: Keep Pi Local + Netlify Public (Current)
- **Pi**: Family/local testing at http://192.168.68.69
- **Netlify**: Public sharing at iloveugo.com
- **Pros**: Secure, fast, professional
- **Cons**: Two sites to maintain

### Option B: Expose Pi to Internet (Advanced)
```bash
# Would require router port forwarding
# Pi accessible at: http://24.151.105.214:PORT
```
- **Pros**: Single site
- **Cons**: Security concerns, slower, technical setup

### Option C: Pi-to-Netlify Bridge (Hybrid)
- Pi updates automatically push to Netlify
- Single source of truth (Pi)
- Best of both worlds

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For Development/Testing:
1. Edit files locally
2. Run `./auto_deploy.sh`
3. Test on Pi: http://192.168.68.69
4. When ready, upload to Netlify for public access

### For Production (After Git Setup):
1. Edit files locally
2. `git push`
3. Both Pi and iloveugo.com update automatically!

```

## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

> "When I update the site on the pi, does it update the netlify thing too?"

**Current Setup**: No, they're separate. You need to manually upload to Netlify.

**With Auto-Deploy**: Yes! Run `./auto_deploy.sh` and both get updated.

**With Git Integration**: Yes! Just `git push` and both sites update automatically.

The Pi (192.168.68.69) and Netlify (iloveugo.com) are two completely different sites. The Pi is only accessible on your local network, while Netlify is public on the internet. But with the auto-deploy system, you can keep them synchronized easily! 🎊
