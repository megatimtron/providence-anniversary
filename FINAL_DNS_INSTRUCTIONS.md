## 🎯 FINAL STEP: Update DNS Records

You now have the **exact** information needed to fix your DNS:

### Required DNS Changes in Your Domain Registrar:

#### 1. **A Record** (Root Domain)
- **Type**: `A`
- **Host**: `@` (or leave blank for root domain)
- **Value**: `75.2.60.5`
- **TTL**: `300`

#### 2. **CNAME Record** (WWW Subdomain)  
- **Type**: `CNAME`
- **Host**: `www`
- **Value**: `poetic-snickerdoodle-92e5d6.netlify.app`
- **TTL**: `300`

#### 3. **Remove All Conflicting Records**
- Delete any A records pointing to GoDaddy IPs (76.223.105.230, 13.248.243.5, etc.)
- Keep only the Netlify A record (75.2.60.5)

❌ A record → 13.248.243.5 (remove)  
❌ Any other A records except Netlify's
```

### Step 3: Add/Update Correct Records
**KEEP/ADD these records:**
```
✅ A record → 75.2.60.5 (Netlify)
✅ CNAME www → poetic-snickerdoodle-92e5d6.netlify.app

2. **Clear Cache**: Safari → Develop → Empty Caches
3. **Incognito Mode**: Test in private browsing

### DNS Issues:
1. **Wait longer**: DNS can take up to 48 hours
